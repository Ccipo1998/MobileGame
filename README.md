# TreeSkier
TreeSkier is an endless run mobile game, where the goal is to survive as long as possible while collecting points. Points can be collected by taking coins or by execute succesfully some acrobatic jumps on the ramps along the way.
There are different types of ramps, each with a different diffuculty and reward (in terms of points gain), and the obstacles (like trees and bombs) should be dodge to avoid loosing life points.
A timer scan the spawing of a fog, which occludes partially the view, but after collecting enough snowflakes, the player become a snowball and it's protected from the next damage.

The game is implemented in Unity.
